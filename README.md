# Opentelemetry POC

## Overview

This is a self-contained proof of concept implemented using [this page](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/python/getting-started/)

## Usage

To run the automatic instrumentation demo: `./run.sh auto`, and the manual demo: `./run.sh manual`.

When the logs are shown, the traces will be displayed immediately. You'll need to wait for about 60 seconds for telemetry metrics to come through.
